        <h1>Should-Cost Analysis Extended Development: Update (9/19/2018)</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The logic for pg_connect in the site has been converted to PDO. For the most part the connections are tested; the only exceptions are on pages that haven't worked for unrelated reasons. They will quite possibly need to be rewritten.</p>
            <p>For the moment, I'm continuing with making the code simpler. A large part of that is going to be uncoupling it from the CSS that is currently an external stylesheet. There are a lot of classes in that CSS, and without being able to actually see the CSS document, it's difficult for me to figure out how the stylesheet works.</p>
            <p>The code on the site itself won't change for some time. For the moment I'm using one particular page to test out the CSS - it's very simple, essentially the old template we were using the build the site with all of the class names stripped out. </p>
            <p><img src="simple_css_091918.png" alt="Screenshot of the very simple CSS sheet in progress"></p>            
            <p><img src="template_091918.png" alt="Screenshot of the template site with the above CSS"></p>
            <p>The above CSS and the template are both very simple. This is how I can figure out exactly how the page was organized in the first place. Once I do that, I can change it if necessary. I'll add more as the work progresses.</p>
