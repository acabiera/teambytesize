        <h1>Should-Cost Analysis Extended Development: Update (11/12/2018)</h1>

        <div>

            <p>I haven't been working as much on this, as people can probably tell. Other things have occupied my mind - job-hunting and school, mostly. When I've had time I've been reviewing Javascript, which is probably my weakest language and one that I need a better grasp on.
           <p>I now understand how to query a database on user input more effectively. I have not yet managed to make it look pretty. (This is the kind of thing that I really thought would be easy to find tutorials for, since there are so many sites that have search bars that autofill.</p>
            <p><img src="search_autocomplete_01.png" alt="autocomplete search bar v. 1">
            <p>The important thing for the moment is creating a way to query the database after typing a letter, instead of querying it before and having the database ready to go. Right now the database is small and everything starts with the same letter, but once I start testing it with actual varied data, this will scale much more efficiently.</p>
            <p>There are security issues - the same that you get with most GET queries, I find, because if someone knows the name of a database table, they can use the queries to search for whatever they want by typing in the HTML manually. Very likely I will make the search page only recognize certain tables. I definitely don't want people to be able to pull passwords from the user table.
            <p>I'll get the CSS right later.</p>
            <p>(My test page is not currently requiring a password, mostly for ease of use. That will change.)
