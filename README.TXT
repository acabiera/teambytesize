Should Cost Analysis
========

The Should Cost Analysis webapp is a simple project that was created to 
demonstrate the possible automation of finding values for Not-For-Resale
items in retail stores.

This site was designed to be used with the following software tools: 
- PostgreSQL 9.6
- PHP 7.2
- Apache 2
- Composer
- Quandl API

Features
--------
Features include:
- Ability to add and view the prices of user-created products
according to an accessible API (Quandl used in testing.)
- Ability to add and view prices of commodities that cannot
be found in the API.
- This site was designed to be deployed to a larger system which would 
include access to an authentication system. A simple PHP session-based
login system was included in order to test the product.
